# Northcoders News API
This project is the server for an News website in its MVP, created to demonstrate my abilities in building a RestFul API.

The project uses JS as its language of choice and ExpressJS as the framework for its ease of use and simplicity; its routing services; and scalability among other reasons, allowing for a server to be rapidly built and deployed as well as future development to take place.
